# db-xpo

To run the application without any manipulation you need to do the following (no need to import in eclipse)
 - download the file, extract it and keep it in your workspace folder 
 - create DB in mysql (I used XAMPP) in the name of 'dbexpo_db' with utf8_bin charset
 - go to project path via COMMAND PROMPT and run the command 'mvn spring-boot:run'
 - go to the browser and hit 'http://localhost:8993/'
